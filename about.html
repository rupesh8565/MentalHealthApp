            <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Mental health impacts how we think, feel, and behave daily. It is important at every stage of life, 
                from childhood through adulthood. Addressing mental health early can help prevent problems from escalating and can support happier, more fulfilling lives.
